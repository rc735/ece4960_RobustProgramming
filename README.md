# ece4960_RobustProgramming

For the diff files in the base directory (diff_program*.txt):

diff_program*_dir.txt:
  Demonstrates the differences between the two directories.
  The files in program5 have removed all object files. The *.cpp files have been renamed to avoid conflicts with same file names from other program assignments.
  
diff_program3_param_extraction.txt:
  Demonstrates the difference between program3/param_extraction.cpp and program5/program3/pg3_param_extraction.cpp
  The files demonstrate the code is the same except for the equation needed for the solver to use.
  
diff_program4_methods.txt
  Demonstrates the difference between program4/methods.cpp and program5/program4/pg4_methods.cpp
  The files demonstrate the code is the same except for the equation needed for the solver to use.
